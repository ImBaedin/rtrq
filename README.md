# RTRQ - Real-Time Real-Quick

A monorepo containing the RTRQ system components.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `apps/manager`: The management interface for RTRQ
- `packages/server`: The core server implementation
- `packages/adapters`: Adapters for different data sources and sinks
  - `adapters/trpc`: tRPC adapter for RTRQ
  - `adapters/react-query`: React Query adapter for RTRQ
- `packages/core`: Core functionality and shared utilities
- `packages/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations
- `packages/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```sh
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```sh
npx turbo link
```
